KPI Dashbaord Updating Instructions:

-In this folder, run 'Table Pulls[DONTPUSH].R

--This file does all the table pulls and saves the csvs locally in the Dashboard Demo Folder under Side Projects. This is where the app
--is expecting to find the final tables that it will use to generate the tables and charts. As of Feb 2019, the sources are beginning
--to breakdown. This is proably because of the Civis migration, but since this project isn't probably going to see the light of day,
--this isn't a huge problem. Someone will have to go through and retool the queries to point at the civis table equivelent once they 
--are all up.

-Push everything EXCEPT the Table pulls file

--There are hardcoded passwords in that file. Don't put it online. Once the civis migration is complete, you won't need to do this 
--anymore and can be free to push the table pulls. 

--There might also be no need for a table pull file as we might have pecific views made for this project.

-Update/re-upload app to shinyapps.io
